Movable Type never lost to WordPress. Show your login screen who's boss.

== Description ==
Since thereâ€™s still quite a few hold-outs on the Movable Type platform, I decided to make the transition to WordPress a little more palatable. I created this simple plugin to replace the WordPress admin login form with the Movable Type login form.

In case you missed the tongue-in-cheek tone, this plugin should only be used for a practical joke amongst true nerds. Next time your buddy leaves his computer, install this gem and watch the chaos and confusion ensue.

== Installation ==
1. Upload "test-plugin.php" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
1. View wp-login.php.

== Changelog ==
= 0.1 =
* Initial release.

== Upgrade Notice ==
= 0.1 =
* Initial release.
